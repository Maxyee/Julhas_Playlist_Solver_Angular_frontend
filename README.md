# Julhas PlayList Solver Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Theme of This Project
This project is simple crud operation between two-end using 'REST API' both Frontend and backend (frontend is developed with Angular 7 which can make request CRUD to the server end. And the backend service is made with Django python framework. That backend service is all made as a repository into my git account. Link is https://github.com/Maxyee/Julhas_playlist_Solver_Django_Backend). Simple Idea is This project hold a users favourite play list of his youtube. Suppose a user have shown so many videos in youtube but he want to collect all of those video as a list of favourite on his own software not in the youtube favourite list.

## How to Run this project on your machine

1. At first install node js to your machine

then run this commant

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

after installing the angular/cli. run another command

`npm install`

Then

`npm start`

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/home`. Because I didn't Implement the Login Register Section Right now. Thats why you need to navigate to this URL.

## NOTE
If you want to fetch data to your home at first you need to Run the backend server and then add some data using this Angular App.


# Application Preview

At first you will see the home page where a REST API request GET is called. Which Brings All of the data from the database about Video.
